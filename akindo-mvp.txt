Architecture  and outline of the Node.js web application for minting files using Zora. 
We will build an MVP Most Viable Product version using iterations defined by Hackathons participation objectives.
On each Iteration we focus on a robust, scalable, and secure setup for the portion added to the Overall Aqua Metaverse DEFI / GameFI platform 

Core Concepts & Technologies:

Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework.

Frontend: Server-Side Rendering with EJS (for simplicity, can be swapped for React/Vue/Svelte later) + Client-Side JavaScript.

Authentication:
 Web2: passport.js with email/password strategy (requires a database).
 Web3: ethers.js (or viem) on the frontend for wallet connection, signing messages for backend verification. Libraries like ConnectKit, RainbowKit, or wagmi simplify frontend wallet UI.

File Handling: multer for uploads. IPFS for decentralized file storage (using ipfs-http-client or a gateway like Pinata/Infura IPFS).

Blockchain Interaction (Zora):
 Zora SDK: We'll primarily use the Zora SDKs (@zoralabs/zora-sdk, @zoralabs/protocol-deployments) or potentially the Zora API for minting actions. The exact method depends on the specific Zora functionality you want (e.g., minting on Zora Network, using Zora Creator Contracts on various chains). The link https://docs.zora.co/coins seems to point broadly to Zora's ecosystem, likely implying minting NFTs via their protocols/networks. We'll assume interaction with Zora's NFT contracts (like ERC721Creator or ERC1155Creator) either directly or via their SDK/API.
 ethers.js / viem: Essential for interacting with smart contracts from the backend (e.g., verifying ownership, potentially gas estimation) and frontend (sending transactions).

Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose ODM) or PostgreSQL (using Sequelize ORM) for storing user data (Web2), potentially minting history, etc.

Environment Variables: dotenv library to manage secrets and configuration.

Deployment: Platform like Render, Heroku, Vercel, or a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)

Step-by-Step Development & Deployment Plan:


------------------
Phase 1: Backend Setup & Basic Server
------------------


1 Initialize Project:  (BASH)

mkdir your-minting-app
cd your-minting-app
npm init -y
git init
echo "node_modules/\n.env" > .gitignore



2 Install Core Dependencies: (BASH)

npm install express ejs dotenv express-session passport passport-local mongoose bcrypt # Or pg sequelize for PostgreSQL
# Dev dependencies (optional but recommended)
npm install --save-dev nodemon



3 Setup server.js :

- Require dependencies (express, dotenv, path, express-session, passport).
- Load environment variables (dotenv.config()).
- Connect to Database (if using one).
- Configure Express app:
 - Set view engine (app.set('view engine', 'ejs');).
 - Serve static files (app.use(express.static('public'));).
 - Middleware for parsing request bodies (express.json(), express.urlencoded({ extended: true })).
 - Session middleware (express-session).
 - Initialize Passport (app.use(passport.initialize()); app.use(passport.session());).
- Define basic routes (e.g., /).
- Start the server (app.listen(...)).


4 Create Basic Views:
- views/partials/header.ejs, views/partials/footer.ejs.
- views/index.ejs (simple landing page).



5 Configure nodemon (Optional): Add a script to package.json:  (JSON)
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js",
  "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}



6 Run: npm run dev and check if the basic index page loads at http://localhost:PORT.



------------------
Phase 2: Web2 Authentication
------------------

1 Setup Database: Choose MongoDB or PostgreSQL. Install necessary drivers/ODMs (Mongoose/Sequelize).



2 Configure Database Connection: Create config/database.js.



3 Create User Model: models/User.js (schema for email, hashedPassword, maybe walletAddress).



4 Configure Passport:
- Create config/passport.js.
- Implement LocalStrategy using the User model.
- Implement serializeUser and deserializeUser.
- Require this config in server.js.



5 Create Auth Routes & Controller:
- routes/auth.js: Define routes for /register, /login, /logout.
- controllers/authController.js: Handle registration (hash password with bcrypt), login (use passport.authenticate('local')), and logout logic.



Create Auth Views:
- views/register.ejs: Form for email/password.
- views/login.ejs: Form for email/password (can later add Web3 login button).



7 Protect Routes: Create middleware/isAuthenticated.js to check req.isAuthenticated(). Apply this middleware to routes that require login (e.g., dashboard, minting page).



 

------------------
Phase 3: Web3 Authentication
------------------

1 Install Frontend Web3 Dependencies:    (BASH)

# No npm install needed if using CDN for ethers.js/viem
# Or if using a frontend framework, install wagmi/ConnectKit/RainbowKit etc.

- Include ethers.js (or viem) in your frontend (e.g., via CDN in header.ejs or bundled).



2 Frontend Wallet Connection (public/js/main.js):

- Add a "Connect Wallet" button to relevant pages (e.g., login.ejs, header.ejs).
- Write JavaScript to:
 - Detect window.ethereum (MetaMask or other EIP-1193 provider).
 - Request accounts (eth_requestAccounts).
 - Get the connected wallet address.



3 Backend Signature Verification:
- Route: Add a route like POST /auth/web3/verify in routes/auth.js.

- Controller Logic (authController.js):
 - Frontend sends the connected address and a signature obtained by signing a specific message (e.g., "Login to Your Minting App").
 - Backend defines the message, uses ethers.verifyMessage(message, signature) to recover the signing address.
 - If recovered address matches the provided address, consider the user authenticated.
 - Find or create a user record associated with this address in your DB.
 - Log the user in using req.login(user, ...).

- Frontend Logic (public/js/main.js):
 - After connecting the wallet, fetch a unique message or nonce from the backend (optional but more secure).
 - Prompt the user to sign the message using signer.signMessage(message).
 - Send the address and signature to the backend verification route.
 - Handle success/failure (e.g., redirect to dashboard).



------------------
Phase 4: File Upload & IPFS Integration
------------------

1 Install Dependencies:     (BASH)

npm install multer ipfs-http-client # Or pinata-sdk if using Pinata

2 Configure Multer: Create middleware/upload.js. Configure storage (e.g., memory storage or temporary disk storage). Set file size limits and filters.

3 Create IPFS Service: services/ipfsService.js.
- Initialize IPFS client (connect to local node, Infura, or Pinata).
- Create a function uploadFileToIPFS(fileBuffer) that takes the file buffer (from req.file.buffer if using memory storage) and uploads it, returning the IPFS CID (Content Identifier).
- Create a function uploadMetadataToIPFS(metadataObject) that takes a JSON object, uploads it, and returns the metadata CID.

4 Create Minting Route & View:
- routes/mint.js: Define routes like GET /mint (show form) and POST /mint (handle upload and minting prep). Apply isAuthenticated middleware.
- views/mint.ejs: Create a form with fields for File upload, NFT Name, Description, etc.
- controllers/mintController.js:
 - Handle the POST /mint request.
 - Use the upload middleware to handle the file (req.file).
 - Call ipfsService.uploadFileToIPFS(req.file.buffer) to get the image CID.
 - Construct the NFT metadata JSON (name, description, image: 'ipfs://<image_cid>').
 - Call ipfsService.uploadMetadataToIPFS(metadata) to get the metadata CID/URI (ipfs://<metadata_cid>).
 - Crucially: Do not mint from the backend directly with a server-side private key. Instead, send the necessary data (metadata URI, potentially contract address, target chain) back to the frontend.


------------------
Phase 5: Zora Minting Integration (Frontend)
------------------

1 Install Zora/Web3 Frontend Dependencies (if not already):   (BASH)

# If using npm with a bundler:
npm install ethers @zoralabs/zora-sdk # Or relevant Zora packages



2 Frontend Minting Logic (public/js/main.js):
- In the mint.ejs page's success handler (after backend uploads to IPFS and returns metadata URI):
 - Ensure the user's wallet is connected.
 - Get an ethers.BrowserProvider and signer.
 - Identify the target Zora contract address and ABI (e.g., ERC721Creator on the desired chain). Get this from Zora's documentation or @zoralabs/protocol-deployments.
 - Instantiate the contract using new ethers.Contract(address, abi, signer).
 - Prepare the arguments for the minting function (e.g., mint, mintWithRewards). This will typically include the tokenURI (the ipfs://<metadata_cid> returned by your backend) and potentially other parameters like recipient address (user's address), royalty info, etc. Consult the specific Zora contract documentation for the function signature.
 - Call the contract's mint function: const tx = await contract.mint(...) or contract.mintWithRewards(...) etc.
 - Wait for the transaction to be mined: const receipt = await tx.wait().
 - Provide feedback to the user (success message with transaction hash, link to explorer, link to NFT on Zora). Handle potential errors.



3 Backend Support (Optional): Your backend could potentially:
- Provide the correct Zora contract addresses/ABIs for the selected chain.
- Store a record of the mint transaction hash associated with the user and file.
- Use a backend provider (ethers.JsonRpcProvider) and Zora SDK/contract instances to read data (e.g., verify NFT ownership later) but never to send transactions requiring user funds.




------------------
Phase 6: Refinement & UI
------------------

1 Improve UI/UX: Style the pages using CSS (public/css/style.css). Make the flow intuitive. Add loading indicators and error messages.

2 Dashboard: Enhance dashboard.ejs to show user info, maybe their minted NFTs (requires reading blockchain data).

3 Error Handling: Implement robust error handling on both frontend and backend.

4 Security:
- Validate all user inputs.
- Protect against CSRF attacks (e.g., using csurf middleware).
- Sanitize outputs to prevent XSS.
- Never store user private keys. All transactions requiring user funds must be signed on the client-side via their wallet.
- Keep backend API keys (IPFS, DB credentials) secure in .env file.



------------------
Phase 7: Deployment
------------------

1 Choose a Hosting Provider: Render, Heroku, Vercel (good for frontend/serverless but check Node.js backend support), AWS EC2/ECS, Google Cloud Run/App Engine. Render is often developer-friendly for Node.js apps.

2 Prepare for Production:
- Set NODE_ENV=production.
- Ensure build steps (if using frontend frameworks) are included.
- Configure logging.

3 Configure Environment Variables: On the hosting platform, set all the variables defined in your .env file (Database URI, Session Secret, IPFS Keys, Zora Contract Addresses, RPC URLs if needed for backend reads). Do not commit your .env file. 
Use .env.example as a template.

4 Deployment Steps (Example using Render):
- Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- Connect your Git repository to Render.
- Create a new "Web Service" on Render.
- Select your repository.
- Configure the build command (usually npm install).
- Configure the start command (usually npm start).
- Set the environment variables in the Render dashboard.
- Deploy! Render will typically build and deploy automatically on pushes to your main branch.

5 Domain & HTTPS: Configure a custom domain and ensure HTTPS is enabled (most platforms handle this automatically).





=========================================================================




Key Next Steps & Considerations:

Security: THIS IS PARAMOUNT. Sanitize ALL inputs (SQL injection, XSS). Validate addresses, percentages. Protect against CSRF. Ensure user authorization (users can only edit/mint their own drafts). Secure private keys/API keys using environment variables and secure practices. Never store private keys in code.
Error Handling: Add comprehensive try-catch blocks, user-friendly error messages, and logging.
Zora Integration Details: The exact functions (mintWithRewards, fee calculation, split contract interaction) and parameters depend heavily on the specific Zora contracts (ERC1155Creator version, ProtocolRewards, SplitMain) deployed on your target chain. Use the Zora SDK where possible to simplify this. Get correct ABIs.
Temporary File Storage: Decide how to handle uploaded files before they go to IPFS (e.g., multer disk storage with cleanup, memory storage for small files, cloud storage like S3).
Frontend Framework: Using a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte would make managing the complex state of the minting form (splits, commissions, previews, gas prices) much easier than vanilla JS/EJS.
Gas Estimation: The gas limit estimation in the frontend is a rough placeholder. Accurately estimating the gas limit for a specific transaction requires more sophisticated simulation or using library estimates (contract.estimateGas.functionName(...)).
Database Indexing: Add indexes to MongoDB fields that are frequently queried (e.g., userId, status).
User Experience: Improve UI feedback, loading states, progress indicators.
Testing: Write unit tests, integration tests, and perform extensive testing on testnets (Goerli, Sepolia, Base Goerli, etc.).






Important Next Steps:

Implement Missing Logic: Fill in the // ... implementation needed ... sections, especially around file handling, specific Zora SDK/contract calls for fee estimation and split management.
Security: Add robust input validation (using libraries like express-validator), proper authentication/authorization checks on all routes, rate limiting, and secure handling of environment variables.
Error Handling: Implement detailed error handling and user feedback loops for all potential failures (network issues, contract reverts, validation errors, IPFS failures).
Configuration: Use environment variables (.env file) extensively for API keys, RPC URLs, contract addresses, IPFS endpoints, temporary directories, etc.
Zora Specifics: Replace placeholder logic for estimateMintFee, findOrCreateSplit, and the exact mintWithRewards (or other mint function) parameters/ABI with code that accurately reflects the Zora contracts on your target network. Using the official Zora SDK is highly recommended here.
Frontend: Build the actual HTML forms (using EJS or another templating engine) corresponding to the backend routes and frontend JS. Implement dynamic adding/removing of creator split inputs. Style the pages.
Testing: Test thoroughly on a test network (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia, Base Goerli) before considering mainnet deployment. Test edge cases, different file types, split configurations, and error conditions.
