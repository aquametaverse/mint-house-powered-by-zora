# Mint House Aqua - BY AQUAMetaverse  🏄‍♀️ Powered by Zora 🎨💰

**Your Not-So-Dry NFT Onramp for the Aqua Metaverse 🌊 - Making it suck less for watercraft creators, coastal artists, and beach bums to mint their gear.**

Alright, listen up Aqua Metaverse citizens and salty dogs! You know what's harder than paddling into a headwind? Getting that rad surfboard shaper from down the coast, or the artist who paints insane seascape murals, or that musician playing seaside gigs, to actually mint their stuff as NFTs for your virtual beach house. They're busy making cool things, not wrangling crypto wallets.

This project (`mint-house-powered-by-zora`) is our attempt to build the **digital slipway** connecting the real-world workshops and studios of **paddleboard, surfboard, kayak, canoe, and watercraft creators**, **coastal artists & decorators**, and **waterside musicians** directly to the shores of the Aqua Metaverse's 3D beaches, rivers, and lakes.

It's a web thingy. They upload their board blueprints, wave paintings, digital twins of physical craft, or sea shanties. We use the dark arts of IPFS and Zora Protocol's nifty contracts to mint 'em onto chains like Base or Zora Network, ready to be flexed in the metaverse (or sold!).

## What This Leaky Codebase Attempts 🛶✨

* **Creator Crew Manifest:** Got a shaper, a painter, *and* a fiberglass guru collaborating on a virtual hydrofoil? Define 'em here, set up the splits. No more "IOU a beer" accounting.
* **IPFS Bilge Pump:** Hoist your designs, art files, music tracks, scanned textures, whatever, into the decentralized cloud (IPFS). We'll try to make sure they don't sink.
* **Zora Protocol Life Raft:** We lean heavily on Zora's creator-friendly contracts to mint NFTs without needing a treasure chest for gas fees. Think efficient minting, proper royalties, referral rewards for your metaverse yacht broker...
* **Automated Booty Sharing 🏴‍☠️💸:** Set up on-chain splits (via Zora Splits, etc.) so when someone buys the NFT of that epic hand-carved paddle, *everyone* involved gets their ETH automatically. Magic internet money, for real (maybe)!
* **Virtual Beach Vendor Commissions:** Give the user who runs the popular Aqua Metaverse surf shop a cut for selling your limited edition digital longboard NFT. Zora's rewards make this less of a headache.
* **(On the Horizon) The Alchemist's Shack 🧪:** Future-proofing! We want users to swap their metaverse tokens or stablecoins for the ETH needed to mint/buy, all in one slightly terrifying atomic transaction. For when you *really* need that virtual kayak *now*.

## The Aqua Metaverse Dream (aka The Delusion) 🏝️🚀

Stop forcing real-world craftspeople and artists to become blockchain nerds just to participate in the virtual economy. Let's make minting authentic, water-inspired gear and art *easy* for the Aqua Metaverse. Less pixelated junk, more soul. WAGMI on water?

## Held Together By Barnacles and... 🔧

* **Backend:** Node.js (Still liking those callbacks?) / Express.js
* **Frontend:** EJS (might upgrade if we find treasure) / CSS / JS
* **Blockchain Navigation:** Ethers.js (the sextant!), Zora SDK (the GPS!), `@zoralabs/protocol-deployments` (the chart!)
* **Decentralized Cargo Hold:** IPFS (via client lib or gateway APIs)
* **Custom Rigging:** Solidity (if we build that Swap-n-Mint galleon or other custom parts)

# Mint House Aqua: Empowering Niche Creators with Collaborative Web3 Tools on Zora

> **Mint House Aqua is a web platform designed to onboard real-world artisans and niche creators – initially focusing on watercraft shapers, coastal artists, and musicians – into the Web3 economy. Leveraging Zora Protocol, our solution simplifies collaborative NFT minting, management, and sales, featuring automated on-chain revenue splitting for creators involved with the Aqua Metaverse and beyond.**

*(This project is built upon the `mint-house-powered-by-zora` codebase developed during the AKINDO WaveHack hackathon.)*

## The Problem

Highly skilled creators and craftspeople, particularly in niche physical markets like surfboard shaping, kayak building, or coastal arts and music, face significant barriers to entering the digital asset economy (NFTs, Metaverses). Existing tools are often too generic, complex for non-Web3 natives, and lack robust support for managing collaborations, intellectual property, and equitable revenue sharing – critical aspects for projects involving multiple contributors (e.g., a shaper + artist collaboration, musical ensembles). This prevents authentic, high-quality content and craftsmanship from effectively transitioning into digital spaces like the Aqua Metaverse.

## Our Solution: Mint House Aqua

Mint House Aqua provides a streamlined, user-friendly web portal specifically addressing these challenges:

-   **Simplified Minting Workflow:** An intuitive interface for creators to upload diverse media (designs, digital twins, art, music), add metadata, and mint NFTs directly to IPFS and the blockchain using Zora contracts.
-   **Collaborative Project Setup:** Enables the definition of multiple creators per project, establishing clear contributions upfront.
-   **Automated On-Chain Revenue Splits:** Integrates with Zora Splits (or similar mechanisms) to automatically distribute primary sales revenue among designated collaborators directly upon purchase, ensuring fairness and transparency.
-   **Sales & Referral Commissions:** Leverages Zora's `ProtocolRewards` framework to implement commission structures, incentivizing marketing and sales within the community.
-   **Targeted Community Focus:** Initially launching with features tailored for creators relevant to the Aqua Metaverse (virtual worlds featuring beaches, rivers, lakes) and its water-themed communities.

## Target Market & Impact

Our primary market includes global communities of watercraft shapers, builders, artists decorating these items, landscape artists inspired by water zones, and musicians associated with coastal lifestyles. This represents a passionate, underserved niche market eager for new monetization avenues. By targeting the Aqua Metaverse community initially, we establish a focused user
